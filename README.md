# Facial-Keypoints

The task at hand involves making predictions about where the keypoints on the face are located in images. This can be useful for various purposes, such as tracking faces in pictures and videos, analyzing facial expressions, identifying medical conditions through dysmorphic facial signs, and implementing biometrics or facial recognition.

Detecting facial keypoints is a complex problem due to the significant variability in facial features across individuals and even within one person, caused by differences in 3D pose, size, position, viewing angle, and lighting. Although computer vision research has made significant progress in tackling these challenges, there is still room for improvement.
